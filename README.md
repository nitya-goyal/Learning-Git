# Learning-Git
This Repo reflects my Journey of learning Git and making 40+ commits just by Practicing Git, from learning basic unix commands to pushing code via git switching from GUI to CLI, it was a great journey, worth remembering, from asking what's a green graph to having 100+ commits in total, and being confident in everything you need to know for being a good developer at version controlling, learnt a lot, gained so much and more to come, thank you so much!
(NOTE: I made this repo Only for Practicing and Learning Git Purpose as a student)
